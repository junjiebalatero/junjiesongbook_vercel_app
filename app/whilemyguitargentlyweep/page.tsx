    [Intro]
    Am Am/G F#m7b5 Fmaj7
    Am G D E
    
    [Verse 1]
    Am          Am/G         F#m7b5            Fmaj7
    I look at you all, see the love there that's sleeping
    Am            G          D Dsus4 D Dsus2 D Esus4 E
    While my guitar gently weeps
    Am          Am/G         F#m7b5       Fmaj7
    I look at the floor, and I see it needs sweeping
    Am            G          C     E
    Still my guitar gently weeps
    
    [Chorus 1]
    A              C#m  F#m        C#m
    I don't know why      nobody told you
    Bm                   E Esus4 E
    How to unfold your love
    A              C#m  F#m            C#m
    I don't know how      someone controlled you
    Bm                     E Esus4 E
    They bought and sold you
    
    [Verse 2]
    Am          Am/G         F#m7b5      Fmaj7
    I look at the world, and I notice it's turning
    Am            G          D Dsus4 D Dsus2 D Esus4 E
    While my guitar gently weeps
        Am       Am/G         F#m7b5    Fmaj7
    With every mistake we must surely be learning
    Am            G          C     E
    Still my guitar gently weeps
    
    [Intrumental]
    Am Am/G F#m7b5 Fmaj7
    Am G D E
    Am Am/G F#m7b5 Fmaj7
    Am G C E
    
    [Chorus 2]
    A              C#m  F#m            C#m
    I don't know how      you were diverted
    Bm                   E Esus4 E
    You were perverted too
    A              C#m  F#m            C#m
    I don't know how      you were inverted
    Bm               E Esus4 E
    No one alerted you
    
    [Verse 3]
    Am          Am/G         F#m7b5            Fmaj7
    I look at you all, see the love there that's sleeping
    Am            G          D Dsus4 D Dsus2 D Esus4 E
    While my guitar gently weeps
    Am          Am/G       F#m7b5       Fmaj7
    Look at you all...
    Am            G          C     E
    Still my guitar gently weeps
    
    [Outro]
    Am Am/G F#m7b5 Fmaj7

    Am Am/G F#m7b5 Fmaj7
    Am G C E
